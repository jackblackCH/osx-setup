## Brew Tools

```

## Install Software/Applications via Brew

## Configs
RCM is a .dotfile manager that allows you to auto-symlink a directory with your dotfiles into your userhome (where they mostly belong to and read by the software).
This enables you to maintain your custom settings within a repository 

```
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install rcm
mkdir ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
git clone git@github.com:jackblackCH/.dotfiles.git .
rcup -v

git config --global user.name "<name>"
git config --global user.email "<mail_address>"
```

## Custom Symlinks for settings/dotfiles which do not belong into userhome / can't be handled by RCM
```
# VSCode
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/keybindings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/snippets/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/snippets
```


## Custom needs
`defaults write co.zeit.hyper ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
